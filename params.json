{"name":"Reldna","tagline":"DNA electrostatics in R","body":"DNA Electrostatics in R\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nFast algorithm of calculation of DNA electrostatics was developed in 1999 by Anatoly Sorokin (@lptolik) and Timur Dzhelyadin. Since then we have looked through regulatory elements of many genomes and show that electrostatical properties of regulatory DNA sites could explain a lot of features of DNA-protein recognition process.\r\n\r\nAll analysis in that papers was done with Matlab, which is not free. Active development of R and Bioconductor project especially make us to migrate our code to R/Bioconductor, so it will be much more accessible to bioinformatics community.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe **reldna** library is pure  R code so it should work on any platform where R is installed.\r\nInstallation process is really straightforward:\r\n\r\n1. Download [latest version](https://github.com/promodel/reldna/blob/master/distr/reldna_0.0-8.20130204.tar.gz) of the library\r\n2. Use standard R installation procedure\r\n   * Chechk that all dependencies are installed in your system\r\n   * Install library \r\n```\r\nR CMD INSTALL reldna_THE_VERSION_YOU_VE_DOWNLOADED.tar.gz\r\n```\r\nNews and results of sequence analysis with **reldna** library are also available at the Laboratory of Cell Genome Functioning Mechanisms [site](http://promodel.icb.psn.ru/publab/?q=en/node/25).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nThere is long list of publications about electrostatic properties of regulatory DNA and bacterial promoters in particular, please cite some of them if you find library useful:\r\n\r\n1.
